## ðŸ“š Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **data science** theories explained with **practical examples, code notebooks and real-world applications**.

It is based on the **coursework and projects** from my **MSc in Data Science and Data Engineering at Uppsala University**.  
I have personally studied each topic in depth and **completed all related assignments and lab work** and **successfully passed the associated exams**.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **structured reference** for fundamental concepts such as **statistics, machine learning, data preprocessing, data pipelines and model deployment** - combining both **theory and hands-on practice**.
